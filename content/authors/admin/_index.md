[**Tatsuki Tsujimori**](https://researchmap.jp/tatsukix/?lang=japanese) is a professor of geological sciences who specializes in metamorphic petrology and regional tectonics, with a particular research focus on the petrogenesis and geochemistry of high-pressure metamorphic rocks such as blueschists and lawsonite eclogites.

He graduated from Shimane U in 1994, and received a master’s degree from Kanazawa U in 1996, then a PhD from Kanazawa U in 1999. After his postdoctoral experiences at OUS/ Okayama U Sci. (2000–2002) and Stanford U (2002–2006), he worked as an assistant professor (2006–2009) and an associate professor (2010–2015) at Okayama U Misasa. In September 2015, he began as a full-professor at Tohoku U. The strength of his research lies in combining fieldwork and geological observations with quantitative petrological and geochronological approaches in metamorphic rocks to understand the geodynamic processes at convergent plate boundaries — from the mineral equilibrium/kinetics scale to the plate tectonic scale. 

Prof. Tsujimori's scholarly accomplishments have received several honors, including the Young Researchers Award (1999) and the Sakuyama Award of the Geol. Soc. Japan (JGS) (2006), the Young Researchers Award of the Japan Assoc. Mineral. Sci. (JAMS/ ex-JAMPEG) (2006), [Fellow of the Mineral. Soc. America](http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/Awards/Fellowslist.html) (MSA) (2013), and [Fellow of the Geol. Soc. America](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Membership/Recognition/GSA_Fellowship/GSA/Awards/Fellows.aspx#T) (GSA) (2014). He is an editorial member of [*J. Metamor. Geol.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15251314), [*PLOS ONE*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/), [*Int. Geol. Rev.*](https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tigr20), [*Island Arc*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14401738), [*Geosci. J.*](https://www.springer.com/journal/12303), [*Rus. Geol.
