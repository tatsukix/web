abstract: "The Ubendian Belt between the Archean Tanzania Craton and the Bangweulu Block, represents a Paleoproterozoic orogeny of these two constituents of the Congo Craton assembled at ~1.8 Ga, forming the Central African Shield, during the Columbia Supercontinent cycle and consolidated during the Gondwana assembly. Metagranitoids from the Southern and Northern Ufipa Terranes (Western Ubendian Corridor) and those of the Bangweulu Block are compositionally similar and are contemporaneous. The protolith of the Ufipa Terrane is originated from the collided crustal rocks of the Bangweulu Block. New LA-ICPMS zircon U–Pb age of metagranitoids and granoporphyries confirmed magmatic events from 1.89 to 1.85 Ga. The metagranitoids of the Western Ubendian Corridor and that of the Bangweulu Block cannot be distinguished by their trace element characteristics and ages. Geochemically, they belong to high-K calc-alkaline to tholeiite series. The 1.89–1.85 Ga metagranitoids and granoporphyries are characterized by evolved nature, which are common for slab-failure derived magmas. Such geochemical features and the presence of ~2.0 Ga eclogites suggest an Orosirian oceanic subduction and subsequent slab break-off. Melt derived from the mafic upper portion of torn slab led to the partial melting of crust which formed high-K and calc-alkaline, I- and S-type magmatism in the Bangweulu Block and the Ufipa Terrane. Zircons from two metagranites from the Northern Ufipa Terrane show Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) overprints at ~570 Ma, suggesting the Bangweulu Block collided with the continental margin of the Tanzania Craton. However, we found non-annealed Orosirian apatites in metagranitoids from the Southern Ufipa Terrane and the Kate–Ufipa Complex, implying that areal heterogeneity of the Pan-African tectonothermal overprint in the Ufipa Terrane. All evidences suggest that the Bangweulu Block and the Ubendian Belt participated in the amalgamation of the Central African Shield as separated continents surrounded by oceanic crusts during the Paleoproterozoic Eburnean and the Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogenies."
