abstract: "Paragonite- and garnet-bearing high-grade epidote-amphibolite (PGEA) in the Ise area of the Hida Mountains, Japan is characterized by the high-pressure (HP) epidote-amphibolite facies parageneses (M1), garnet + hornblende + clinozoisite + paragonite + quartz + rutile. Paragonite and garnet of the peak M1 stage are locally replaced by retrograde albite (+ oligoclase) and chlorite (M2), respectively. Phase equilibria constrain peak metamorphic conditions of P = 1.1–1.4 GPa and T = 530–570 °C, and a decompressional P–T path for this rock. Mineral parageneses of prograde epidote-amphibolite facies are comparable to some HP rocks from the Hongan region of western Dabie, but differ from other HP mafic schists with cooling ages of c. 330 Ma in the Hida Mountains. New paragonite K–Ar dating for the PGEA yields a Triassic cooling event at 210 Ma that is coeval with regional cooling and exhumation of the Sulu–Dabie–Qinling (SDQ) belt. Both petrological and geochronological data of the Triassic HP epidote-amphibolite in Hida Mountains support our earlier hypothesis that the SDQ belt extends across the Korean Peninsula to SW Japan."
