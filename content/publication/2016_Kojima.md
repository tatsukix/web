abstract: "Accretionary complexes (AC) form at convergent plate margins by the subduction of oceanic plate underneath the continental plate (Fig. 2b.1). The oceanic plate is created at the mid-oceanic ridge, and moves to the trench while accumulating pelagic sediments. After arriving at the trench, where the pelagic sediments are covered by continent-derived clastic materials, the plate is subducted and part of the sediments accrete to the continental plate, producing fault stacking and several types of m√®langes (Fig. 2b.1). The characteristic AC succession re?ects the ocean plate stratigraphy (OPS) (Matsuda & Isozaki 1991) starting with basaltic basement covered by radiolarian ribbon chert, then siliceous mudstone and ?nally coarse clastic rocks."
