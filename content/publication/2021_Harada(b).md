abstract: "The Hida Belt, central Japan, is a continental fragment, which was once a part of the crustal basement of the East Asian continental margin. It consists mainly of Permo-Triassic granite-gneiss complexes with both syn-to-late-metamorphic migmatite or granite bodies. Clinopyroxene-bearing leucogranite, locally called as 'Inishi'-type migmatite, occurs characteristically in the migmatite zone associated with amphibolite and marble. The leucogranite is characterized by the presence of coarse-grained diopside–hedenbergite series clinopyroxene and titanite in plagioclase-dominated matrix. Clinopyroxene contains abundant calcite inclusions. Euhedral titanite with high Th/U ratios (~2.8–7.8) and REE contents (~4514–14069 μg/g) contains polycrystalline 'granitic' inclusions. Those mineralogical features indicate the involvement of carbonate during anatexis. Considering a nominal pressure of 0.4–0.7 GPa of the Hida gneiss, Zr-in-titanite thermometry yields a temperature of 730–810 °C and 770–850 °C at aTiO2 = 0.5 and 1, respectively. The titanites show highly variable U/Pb (238U/206Pb = 15.0–24.0) and Pb (207Pb/206Pb = 0.172–0.419) isotope ratios, and the scattered trend follows a discordia line with a lower intercept at 225.4 ± 1.9 Ma. This titanite age would represent the timing of regional anatexis that have occurred in a later stage of the regional metamorphism of the Hida Belt. A high apparent thermal gradient at middle crustal levels might have caused by regional extension."
