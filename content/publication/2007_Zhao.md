abstract: "Garnet clinopyroxenite at Rizhao occurs as a lens 100 x 225 m2 within a serpentinized peridotite body, in fault contact with felsic gneiss. Minor dunite also occurs within the same peridotite. The clinopyroxenite consists of porphyroblastic Grt-bearing (type 1), megacrystic Grt-bearing (type 2), porphyroblastic Cpx-bearing (type 3), and equigranular (type 4) garnet clinopyroxenite. Lamellaerich, coarse-grained Cpx occurs as inclusions in megacrystic Grt from type 2 clinopyroxenite, and as porphyroblasts in a matrix of Cpx + Grt + Ilm from type 3 clinopyroxenite; these clinopyroxenes contain abundant exsolution lamellae of Grt (Prp16-19Grs62Alm19-21Sps1) + Ilm ± Mag ± Amp (Mg#: 0.88-0.98; Na2O: 0.5-3.3 wt%; K2O: 0.7-1.0 wt%; TiO2: 0.1-0.2 wt%). Megacrystic and porphyroblastic garnet (Prp35-42Grs34-45Alm19-24Sps1) also occurs in a matrix of fine-grained Cpx + Grt + Ilm; spinel (Mg#: 0.60-0.62) is present as inclusions in both porphyroblastic Grt and lamellae-rich Cpx. Petrochemical data support a mantle origin involving crystallization of majoritic garnet. We propose that the protolith of the Rizhao clinopyroxenite initially was a spinel clinopyroxenite, and was convected to great depths (>450 km) to form a majoritic garnet that contains high CaO and considerable amounts of FeO and TiO2. During later decompression, the majoritic garnet broke down to form intergrowths of Cpx + Grt + Ilm ± Mag ± Amp at T = 700-800°C, P ≤ 3 GPa. It was then emplaced into a subduction zone and experienced UHP metamorphism at 620-880°C, 3 GPa during Triassic continental collision. Megacrystic/porphyroblastic garnet formed during this stage, and lamellaerich Cpx recrystallized to the matrix assemblage of Cpx + Grt + Ilm subsequently. The clinopyroxenite also experienced later retrogression during exhumation. Zircon U-Pb geochronology yields 215 ± 2 Ma for the Rizhao garnet clinopyroxenite; occurrence of garnet and clinopyroxene inclusions in zircon suggests that this age reflects the UHP metamorphism."
