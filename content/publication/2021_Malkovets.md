abstract: "New mineralogical and isotope–geochemical data for zircon megacrysts (n = 48) from alluvium of Kholomolokh Creek (a tributary of the Ebelakh River) are reported. Using the geochemical classification schemes, the presence of zircons of kimberlitic and carbonatitic genesis was shown. The U–Pb dating of zircons revealed two major age populations: the Triassic (258–221 Ma, n = 18) and Jurassic (192–154 Ma, n = 30). Weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages allowed us to distinguish the following age stages: 155 ± 3, 161 ± 2, 177 ± 1.5, 183 ± 1.5, 190 ± 2, 233 ± 2.5, and 252 ± 4 Ma. It is suggested that the Ebelyakh diamonds could have been transported from the mantle depths by kimberlite, as well as by other related rocks, such as carbonatite, lamprophyre, lamproite, olivine melilitite, etc. Diamonds from the Ebelyakh placers most likely have polygenic native sources and may be associated with polychronous and multistage Middle Paleozoic and Mesozoic kimberlite and alkaline–ultrabasic magmatism in the eastern slope of the Anabar Shield (the Ebelyakh, Mayat, and Billyakh river basins)."
