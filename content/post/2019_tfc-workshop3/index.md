### Workshop 3: Continental Amalgamation and Stabilization of Northeast Asia: Stories before the Stone Age
{{< gallery >}}

I'm organizing an international workshop '[Continental Amalgamation and Stabilization of Northeast Asia: Stories before the Stone Age](http://www.tfc.tohoku.ac.jp/event/4224.html)' `from 21 to 22 of February 2019` in Sendai. This workshop, sponsored by the Tohoku Forum for Creativity (TFC), Organization for Research Promotion, Tohoku University, is one of four planned under the Thematic Program "**[Geologic Stabilization and Human Adaptations in Northeast Asia](http://www.tfc.tohoku.ac.jp/program/2152.html)**" by Hiroki Takakura, me (Tatsuki Tsujimori), Kaoru Akoshima, Yoshitaka Kanomata, Hitoshi Yamada, Hiroki Oka and Satoshi Chiba. 

Specific focus in this workshop includes 'lithospheric and crustal evolution and stabilization". However, this workshop also aims to provide opportunities to link geological sciences to ecology, archeology, and socio-cultural anthropology and to systematize interdisciplinary knowledge on Northeast Asia. I've invited great speakers from various countries. 

Below is the list of speakers.  

* **Gina Barnes** (University of London)
* **Ilona Bausch** (Kokugakuin University Museum / Sainsbury Institute for the Study of Japanese Arts & Cultures)
* **Uyanga Bold** (Mongolian University of Science and Technology)
* **Moonsup Cho** (Seoul National University)
* **Sun-Lin Chung** (Academia Sinica / National Taiwan University)
* **Yoshiyuki Iizuka** (Academia Sinica)
* **Yukio Isozaki** (University of Tokyo)
* **Sergey Krivonogov** (Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences)
* **Shigenori Maruyama** (Tokyo Institute of Technology)
* **William F. McDonough** (University of Maryland / Tohoku University)
* **Daniel Pastor-Gal√°n** (University of Salamanca)
* **Inna Safonova** (Novosibirsk State University)
* **Guanghai Shi** (China University of Geosciences)
* **Kuo-Lung Wang** (Academia Sinica)
* **Dapeng Zhao** (Tohoku University)
